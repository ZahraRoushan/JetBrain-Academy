I am sharing the codes that I've written for different projects on JetBrain Academy python course. So far it includes: <br>
- Bill Spliter <br>
- Knight's tour Puzzle <br>
- Tic-Tac-Toe with AI <br>

As it might be obvieous, I'm learning to code through these challenges, so they are far from efficient. Hopefully I will get back at them and laugh at the simple mistakes, but that's just how we learn!
